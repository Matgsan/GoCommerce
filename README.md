# GoCommerce
Simple React Native eCommerce mobile application.

# Running the app
1- `npm install` 

2- `npm install json-server`

3- `json-server server.json`

4- As this is in a development enviorinment, if you are running in an Android emulator WITHOUT genymotion, you will need to change the API url. Open the `src/services/api.js` and change `10.0.3.2` to `10.0.2.2`. If you testing through genymotion or in a iOS emulator, you are fine.

5- `react-native run-ios` or `react-native run-android`
